Build It Bigger

Udacity - Android Developer Nanodegree - Project 4: Build It Bigger

As Android projects grow in complexity, it becomes necessary to customize the behavior of the Gradle build tool, allowing automation of repetitive tasks. Particularly, factoring functionality into libraries and creating product flavors allow for much bigger projects with minimal added complexity.

Project Description:

Step 0: Starting Point

This is the starting point for the final project, which is provided to you in the course repository. It contains an activity with a banner ad and a button that purports to tell a joke, but actually just complains. The banner ad was set up following the instructions here:

https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/admob/android/quick-start

You may need to download the Google Repository from the Extras section of the Android SDK Manager.

When you can build an deploy this starter code to an emulator, you're ready to move on.
